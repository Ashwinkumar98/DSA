/*
You are given an integer array weight of length n, representing the weights of n parcels arranged in a straight line. A shipment is defined as a contiguous subarray of parcels. A shipment is considered balanced if the weight of the last parcel is strictly less than the maximum weight among all parcels in that shipment.

Select a set of non-overlapping, contiguous, balanced shipments such that each parcel appears in at most one shipment (parcels may remain unshipped).

Return the maximum possible number of balanced shipments that can be formed.

Â 

Example 1:

Input: weight = [2,5,1,4,3]

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can form the maximum of two balanced shipments as follows:

Shipment 1: [2, 5, 1]
Maximum parcel weight = 5
Last parcel weight = 1, which is strictly less than 5. Thus, it's balanced.
Shipment 2: [4, 3]
Maximum parcel weight = 4
Last parcel weight = 3, which is strictly less than 4. Thus, it's balanced.
It is impossible to partition the parcels to achieve more than two balanced shipments, so the answer is 2.
